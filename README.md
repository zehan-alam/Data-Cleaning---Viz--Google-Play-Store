## Analysis of Google Play Store Data

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Google Play Store data, comprising 10,841 entries. Leveraging Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries, I performed data cleaning and visualization to extract meaningful insights from each column.

### Key Findings
- **Category:** Corrected capitalization errors and visualized the distribution of app categories. The top three categories are Family, Game, and Tools.
- **Rating:** Most apps have a rating of 3.25 or higher.
- **Reviews:** Analyzed the distribution of reviews and categorized them into six groups ('Under 100', '100+', '10k+', '100k+', '1M+', '5M+'). The majority of apps have 100-10k reviews.
- **Size:** Extracted numeric values from the dataset and visualized the distribution using a KDE plot, revealing a right-skewed distribution with most apps ranging from 0-20MB.
- **Installs:** Created a bar plot to illustrate the number of apps in each installation category, sorted by installation groups.
- **Type:** Most apps are free.
- **Price:** Identified that most paid apps are priced around $5.
- **Content Rating:** Found that most apps are rated for everyone.
- **Genres:** Sorted genres by the number of apps and visualized them using a horizontal bar plot. Tools, Education, and Entertainment are the top genres.
- **Last Updated:** Most apps have been updated within the last year.
- **Android Version:** Apps are compatible with Android 4 and above.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the Google Play Store ecosystem, offering actionable information for developers and stakeholders.
